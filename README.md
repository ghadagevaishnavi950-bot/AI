Project Title: Generative AI RAG_PDF
🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to work directly with PDF documents.
It enables an AI model to read, retrieve, and reason over real PDF data — giving accurate, context-based answers instead of generic responses.

🎯 Objective
To build a pipeline that:
Loads and processes PDF documents (like research papers, government reports, or policies).
Splits text into chunks for efficient retrieval.
Creates embeddings and stores them in a vector database (like Chroma or FAISS).
Uss LLMs (e.g., Groq or Llama 3) to generate intelligent answers based on document context.

🧩 Key Features
📄 Automatic PDF text extraction
🧠 Context-aware Q&A using LLMs
🗂️ Vector-based document retrieval
⚙️ Modular scripts: ingestion, embedding, and querying
🔗 Easily extendable for research, budget analysis, or policy review

💻 Tech Stack
Languages: Python
Libraries: LangChain, ChromaDB, Groq LLM, dotenv
Model: Llama 3 / Groq model
